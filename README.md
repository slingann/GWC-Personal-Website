# Personal Website (GWC SIP)
### 👩🏽‍💻 About the Project
This is my Personal Website for the 2021 Girls Who Code Virtual Summer Immersion Program. It was the first project I worked on during the Summer Immersion Program, and I created it using HTML and CSS over the course of two days. This website's purpose is to allow visitors to get to know me! I included images, facts about myself, and my favorite songs in this website, allowing users to learn more about and connect with me.
