          <b>Music Recommender</b> - 2021
          <br>I created this project using JavaScript and the p5.js library. I worked on this project to display the knowledge I gained during a Foundations of Computer Programming course. This program recommends various albums and songs to users using iframes. I would like to expand this idea in the future.

          <br>I created this project during the two weeks I spent participating in Girls Who Code's Virtual Summer Immersion Program! I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an activist toolkit that informs site visitors about gender inequality in STEM and business, which are male-dominated fields. I believe that "male-dominated" should not be another word for "male-exclusive".
