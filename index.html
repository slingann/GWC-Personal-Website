          My name is Samiksha Lingan and I am student interested in computer science. I am passionate about social and environmental issues such as racism, gender inequality, educational disparities, and climate change. As someone who was first exposed to coding and technology as an elementary school student, I understand the importance of giving young people access to technology and adequate STEM education.
